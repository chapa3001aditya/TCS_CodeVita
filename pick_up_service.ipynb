    "Problem Description\n",
    "James is a truck driver, who travels through multiple cities and picks up the goods from those cities which are to be sent overseas. Initially, he will start from city A and then travel through all the cities, collects goods and then brings them back to city A.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each city have only one path from city A and each city have k number of goods that are to be picked. James will prioritize the cities with more number of goods ie., if he is currently in city A and B,C are his neighbouring cities then he will prioritize B if it has more number of goods or vice versa. If both B and C have equal number of goods, then he will choose the city with minimum entry tax. The entry tax is the amount that we need to pay at the check post in order to enter into a city. In case of equal tax, he will head over to the city which comes first, lexicographically.\n",
    "\n",
    "James need to travel to all the cities and pickup the packages and return back to the starting city. Here once we reached the terminal city, we have to backtrack to particular city and continue to follow the rules for forward propagation and make sure we cover all other cities. Given the paths between these cities, number of goods in each city and the entry taxes of the cities, print the route map of his entire journey and the minimum tax he need pay.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The starting city is exempted from entry tax i.e. any number of times that James enters the starting city, he will be exempt from paying any tax.\n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints\n",
    "1 <= number of cities <= 10^3\n",
    "\n",
    "1 <= number of goods in each city <= 10^3\n",
    "\n",
    "1 <= entry tax of each city <=10^4\n",
    "\n",
    "Input\n",
    "First line consists of an integer N, representing the total number of cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next N-1 lines consists of four values in the format, \"city1 city2 integer1 integer2\" representing there exists a route from city1 to city2, the number of goods in the city2 is integer1 and the entry tax of city2 is integer2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output\n",
    "Print the route map of his entire journey where route map refers to the order of cities he followed separated by a hyphen and the total tax he paid in two different lines.\n",

    "James journey starts in hyderabad. By following the given rules and to achieve minimum tax, he will choose the city with more numbers of goods to be picked up ie., pune. From pune he will go to kasi followed by manali and returns back to hyderabad. He then goes to delhi, followed by kolkata and then returns back to delhi. From there he goes to chennai followed by madhurai and then finally returns to hyderabad.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the route map will look like hyderabad -> pune -> kasi -> manali -> kasi -> pune -> hyderabad -> delhi -> kolkata -> delhi -> chennai -> madhurai -> chennai -> delhi -> hyderabad.\n",
