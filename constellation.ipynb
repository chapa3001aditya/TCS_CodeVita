    "Three characters { #, *, . } represents a constellation of stars and galaxies in space. Each galaxy is demarcated by # characters. There can be one or many stars in a given galaxy. Stars can only be in the shape of vowels { A, E, I, O, U }. A collection of * in the shape of the vowels is a star. A star is contained in a 3x3 block. Stars cannot be overlapping. The dot(.) character denotes empty space.\n",
