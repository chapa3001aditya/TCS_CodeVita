    "Here on earth, our 24-hour day is composed of two parts, each of 12 hours. Each hour in each part has a corresponding hour in the other part separated by 12 hours: the hour essentially measures the duration since the start of the daypart. For example, 1 hour in the first part of the day is equivalent to 13, which is 1 hour into the second part of the day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, consider the equivalent hours that are both prime numbers. We have 3 such instances for a 24-hour 2-part day:\n",
    "\n",
    "5~17\n",
    "\n",
    "7~19\n",
    "\n",
    "11~23\n",
    "\n",
    "Accept two natural numbers D, P >1 corresponding respectively to several hours per day and the number of parts in a day separated by a space. D should be divisible by P, meaning that the number of hours per part (D/P) should be a natural number. Calculate the number of instances of equivalent prime hours. Output zero if there is no such instance. Note that we require each equivalent hour in each part of a day to be a prime number.\n",

    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: 24 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: 3 (We have 3 instances of equivalent prime hours: 5~17, 7~19, and 11~23.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "10 <= D < 500\n",
    "\n",
    "2 <= P < 50\n",
    "\n",
    "Input\n",
    "\n",
    "The single line consists of two space-separated integers, D and P corresponding to the number of. hours per day and number of parts in a day respectively\n",
    "\n",
    "Output\n",
    "\n",
    "Output must be a single number, corresponding to the number of instances of equivalent prime number, as described above\n",

    "Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the given test case D = 36 and P = 3\n",
